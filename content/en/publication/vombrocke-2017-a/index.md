abstract: Design Science Research (DSR) is now an accepted research paradigm in the
  Information Systems (IS) field, aiming at developing purposeful IT artifacts and
  knowledge about the design of IT artifacts. A rich body of knowledge on approaches,
  methods, and frameworks supports researchers in conducting DSR projects. While methodological
  guidance is abundant, there is little support and guidance for documenting and effectively
  managing DSR processes. In this article, we present a set of design principles for
  tool support for DSR processes along with a prototypical implementation (MyDesignProcess.com).
  We argue that tool support for DSR should enable researchers and teams of researchers
  to structure, document, maintain, and present DSR, including the resulting design
  knowledge and artifacts. Such tool support can increase traceability, collaboration,
  and quality in DSR. We illustrate the use of our prototypical implementation by
  applying it to published cases, and we suggest guidelines for using tools to effectively
  manage design-oriented research.

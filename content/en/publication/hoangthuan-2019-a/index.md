abstract: Posing research questions represents a fundamental step to guide and direct
  how researchers develop knowledge in research. In design science research (DSR),
  researchers need to pose research questions to define the scope and the modes of
  inquiry, characterize the artifacts, and communicate the contributions. Despite
  the importance of research questions, research provides few guidelines on how to
  construct suitable DSR research questions. We fill this gap by exploring ways of
  constructing DSR research questions and analyzing the research questions in a sample
  of 104 DSR publications. We found that about two-thirds of the analyzed DSR publications
  actually used research questions to link their problem statements to research approaches
  and that most questions focused on solving problems. Based on our analysis, we derive
  a typology of DSR question formulation to provide guidelines and patterns that help
  researchers formulate research questions when conducting their DSR projects.

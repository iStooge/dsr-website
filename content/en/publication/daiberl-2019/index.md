abstract:
  Innovation in the medical technology (med tech) industry has a major impact
  on well-being in society. Open innovation has the potential to accelerate the development
  of new or improved healthcare solutions. Building on work system theory (WST), this
  paper explores how a multi-sided open innovation platform can systematically be
  established in a German med tech industry cluster in situations where firms had
  no prior experience with this approach. We aim to uncover problems that may arise
  and identify opportunities for overcoming them. We performed an action research
  study in which we implemented and evaluated a multi-sided web-based open innovation
  platform in four real-world innovation challenges. Analyzing the four different
  challenges fostered a deeper understanding of the conceptual and organizational
  aspects of establishing the multi-sided open innovation platform as part of a larger
  work system. Reflecting on the findings, we developed five design principles that
  shall support the establishment of multi-sided open innovation platforms in other
  contexts. Thus, this paper contributes to both theory and practice.

abstract: One of the most critical tasks for startups is to validate their business
  model. Therefore, entrepreneurs try to collect information such as feedback from
  other actors to assess the validity of their assumptions and make decisions. However,
  previous work on decisional guidance for business model validation provides no solution
  for the highly uncertain and complex context of earlystage startups. The purpose
  of this paper is, thus, to develop design principles for a Hybrid Intelligence decision
  support system (HI-DSS) that combines the complementary capabilities of human and
  machine intelligence. We follow a design science research approach to design a prototype
  artifact and a set of design principles. Our study provides prescriptive knowledge
  for HI-DSS and contributes to previous work on decision support for business models,
  the applications of complementary strengths of humans and machines for making decisions,
  and support systems for extremely uncertain decision-making problems.

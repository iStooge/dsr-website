abstract: Digitalization triggers a shift in the compositions of skills and knowledge
  needed for students in their future work life. Hence, higher order thinking skills
  are becoming more important to solve future challenges. One subclass of these skills,
  which contributes significantly to communication, collaboration and problem-solving,
  is the skill of how to argue in a structured, reflective and well-formed way. However,
  educational organizations face difficulties in providing the boundary conditions
  necessary to develop this skill, due to increasing student numbers paired with financial
  constraints. In this short paper, we present the first steps of our design science
  research project on how to design an adaptive IT-tool that helps students develop
  their argumentation skill through formative feedback in large-scale lectures. Based
  on scientific learning theory and user interviews, we propose preliminary requirements
  and design principles for an adaptive argumentation learning tool. Furthermore,
  we present a first instantiation of those principles.

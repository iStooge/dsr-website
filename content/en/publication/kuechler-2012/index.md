abstract: "One point of convergence in the many recent discussions on design science\
  \ research in information systems (DSRIS) has been the desirability of a directive\
  \ design theory (ISDT) as one of the outputs from a DSRIS project. However, the\
  \ literature on theory development in DSRIS is very sparse. In this paper, we develop\
  \ a framework to support theory development in DSRIS and explore its potential from\
  \ multiple perspectives. The framework positions ISDT in a hierarchy of theories\
  \ in IS design that includes a type of theory for describing how and why the design\
  \ functions: Design-relevant explanatory/predictive theory (DREPT). DREPT formally\
  \ captures the translation of general theory constructs from outside IS to the design\
  \ realm. We introduce the framework from a knowledge representation perspective\
  \ and then provide typological and epistemological perspectives. We begin by motivating\
  \ the desirability of both directive-prescriptive theory (ISDT) and explanatory-predictive\
  \ theory (DREPT) for IS design science research and practice. Since ISDT and DREPT\
  \ are both, by definition, mid-range theories, we examine the notion of mid-range\
  \ theory in other fields and then in the specific context of DSRIS. We position\
  \ both types of theory in Gregor's (2006) taxonomy of IS theory in our typological\
  \ view of the framework. We then discuss design theory semantics from an epistemological\
  \ view of the framework, relating it to an idealized design science research cycle.\
  \ To demonstrate the potential of the framework for DSRIS, we use it to derive ISDT\
  \ and DREPT from two published examples of DSRIS."

abstract:
  We develop an empirically grounded understanding of how design knowledge
  accumulates over time. Drawing from theory on knowledge creation, we conceptualize
  accumulation along the goals and scope of knowledge in DSR as a distinct knowledge
  creation problem. Through two empirical studies, we theorize knowledge accumulation
  in DSR by unpacking (1) three knowledge creation mechanisms, and (2) explaining
  how their interplay forms different patterns of knowledge creation over time. We
  contribute a theoretical framework conducive to integrating knowledge produced through
  different methods by introducing the knowledge creation processes as a distinct
  unit of analysis in DSR and by pointing out that extant procedural models may need
  revision to account for the continuous knowledge creation occurring in potentially
  multiyear DSR projects.

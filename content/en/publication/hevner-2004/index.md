abstract: 'Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems
  discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm
  seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational
  behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and
  organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms
  are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of
  people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance
  of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework
  and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research.
  In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain
  and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact.
  Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application
  of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing
  high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.'

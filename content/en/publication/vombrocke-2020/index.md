abstract: Sir Isaac Newton famously said, \"If I have seen further it is by standing
  on the shoulders of giants.\" Research is a collaborative, evolutionary endeavor-and
  it is no different with design science research (DSR) which builds upon existing
  design knowledge and creates new design knowledge to pass on to future projects.
  However, despite the vast, growing body of DSR contributions, scant evidence of
  the accumulation and evolution of design knowledge is found in an organized DSR
  body of knowledge. Most contributions rather stand on their own feet than on the
  shoulders of giants, and this is limiting how far we can see; or in other words,
  the extent of the broader impacts we can make through DSR. In this editorial, we
  aim at providing guidance on how to position design knowledge contributions in wider
  problem and solution spaces. We propose (1) a model conceptualizing design knowledge
  as a resilient relationship between problem and solution spaces, (2) a model that
  demonstrates how individual DSR projects consume and produce design knowledge, (3)
  a map to position a design knowledge contribution in problem and solution spaces,
  and (4) principles on how to use this map in a DSR project. We show how fellow researchers,
  readers, editors, and reviewers, as well as the IS community as a whole, can make
  use of these proposals, while also illustrating future research opportunities.

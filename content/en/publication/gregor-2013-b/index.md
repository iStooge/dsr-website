abstract: Design science research (DSR) has staked its rightful ground as an important
  and legitimate Information Systems (IS) research paradigm. We contend that DSR has
  yet to attain its full potential impact on the development and use of information
  systems due to gaps in the understanding and application of DSR concepts and methods.
  This essay aims to help researchers (1) appreciate the levels of artifact abstractions
  that may be DSR contributions, (2) identify appropriate ways of consuming and producing
  knowledge when they are preparing journal articles or other scholarly works, (3)
  understand and position the knowledge contributions of their research projects,
  and (4) structure a DSR article so that it emphasizes significant contributions
  to the knowledge base. Our focal contribution is the DSR knowledge contribution
  framework with two dimensions based on the existing state of knowledge in both the
  problem and solution domains for the research opportunity under study. In addition,
  we propose a DSR communication schema with similarities to more conventional publication
  patterns, but which substitutes the description of the DSR artifact in place of
  a traditional results section. We evaluate the DSR contribution framework and the
  DSR communication schema via examinations of DSR exemplar publications.

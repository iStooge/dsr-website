abstract: The authors critically review systems development in information systems
  (IS) research. Several classification schemes of research are described and systems
  development is identified as a developmental, engineering, and formulative type
  of research. A framework of research is proposed to explain the dual nature of systems
  development as a research methodology and a research domain in IS research. Progress
  in several disciplinary areas is reviewed to provide a basis to argue that systems
  development is a valid research methodology. A systems development research process
  is presented from a methodological perspective. Software engineering, the basic
  method is applying the systems development research methodology, is then discussed.
  A framework to classify IS research domain and various research methodologies in
  studying systems development is presented. It is suggested that systems development
  and empirical research methodologies are complementary to each other. It is further
  proposed that an integrated multidimensional and multimethodological approach will
  generate fruitful research results in IS research.

abstract: With the rising interest in Design Science Research (DSR), it is crucial
  to engage in the ongoing debate on what constitutes an acceptable contribution for
  publishing DSR - the design artifact, the design theory, or both. In this editorial,
  we provide some constructive guidance across different positioning statements with
  actionable recommendations for DSR authors and reviewers. We expect this editorial
  to serve as a foundational step towards clarifying misconceptions about DSR contributions
  and to pave the way for the acceptance of more DSR papers to top IS journals.

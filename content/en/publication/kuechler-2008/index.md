abstract: 'The common understanding of design science research in information systems
  (DSRIS) continues to evolve. Only in the broadest terms has there been consensus:
  that DSRIS involves, in some way, learning through the act of building. However,
  what is to be built – the definition of the DSRIS artifact – and how it is to be
  built – the methodology of DSRIS – has drawn increasing discussion in recent years.
  The relationship of DSRIS to theory continues to make up a significant part of the
  discussion: how theory should inform DSRIS and whether or not DSRIS can or should
  be instrumental in developing and refining theory. In this paper, we present the
  exegesis of a DSRIS research project in which creating a (prescriptive) design theory
  through the process of developing and testing an information systems artifact is
  inextricably bound to the testing and refinement of its kernel theory.'

abstract: 'This essay derives a schema for specifying design principles for information
  technology-based artifacts in sociotechnical systems. Design principles are used
  to specify design knowledge in an accessible form, but there is wide variation and
  lack of precision across views on their formulation. This variation is a sign of
  important issues that should be addressed, including a lack of attention to human
  actors and levels of complexity as well as differing views on causality, on the
  nature of the mechanisms used to achieve goals, and on the need for justificatory
  knowledge. The new schema includes the well-recognized elements of design principles,
  including goals in a specific context and the mechanisms to achieve the goal. In
  addition, the schema allows: (i) consideration of the varying roles of the human
  actors involved and the utility of design principles; (ii) attending to the complexity
  of IT-based artifacts through decomposition;(iii) distinction of the types of causation
  (i.e., deterministic versus probabilistic); (iv) a variety of mechanisms in achieving
  aims; and (v) the optional definition of justificatory knowledge underlying the
  design principles. We illustrate the utility of the proposed schema by applying
  it to examples of published research.'

abstract: 'The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology
  for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of
  importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several
  researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little
  DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve
  as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation
  may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology
  (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required
  to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior
  literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides
  a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes
  six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for
  a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication.
  We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms
  of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health
  assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application,
  and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three
  objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the
  IS discipline.'

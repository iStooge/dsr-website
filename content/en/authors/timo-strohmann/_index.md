### Founder and Author of this Website

I created this site to share knowledge and experiences about the research method Design Science Research with scientists and interested people.

### My Research

My design-oriented research is centered around the application of conversational agents in different contexts, like in-vehicle assistance, creativity support or virtual facilitation. My publications include studies of implemented conversational agents as well as prescriptive knowledge on how to design them. I especially focus on designing the human-machine interaction in a forward-thinking manner by investigating the concept of virtual companionship.

### Author

Design Science Research is still a relatively new research paradigm in Information Systems. Therefore, it is all the more important to provide basic knowledge for doctoral students and those interested in design-oriented research.

### Meine Forschung

In my largely design-oriented research, I deal with the design of digital collaboration, creativity support and innovation management. In doing so, I increasingly focus on the use of intelligent services and systems that support users in their value creation. This creates new forms of interaction and collaboration between humans and AI-based systems, which change the world of work and thus also our digital society. My publications include a number of developed artifacts, experimental studies, design knowledge in the form of design principles, but also empirical (quantitative) studies that contribute to the design of new forms of value creation between humans and intelligent systems.

Welcome to this website! I am Timo and a postdoctoral researcher at the Technische Universität Braunschweig. In my design-oriented research about conversational agents for different use cases, such as in-vehicle assistance or creativity support, I have intensively dealt with the research methodology Design Science Research and would now like to share my knowledge and experiences.

Of course there are already very good and well-founded scientific publications concerning this research methodology, so why do one would need this site? I have made the experience as a doctoral student that learning from others about the usage of this method is an enormous value. For example, getting started is made easier if someone tells you which publications to read and in which order to start. First-hand experiences are very valuable and not everything can always be communicated in the context of a scientific publication, as it might be possible in a personal conversation.

So with this platform I would like to offer the possibility to learn from each other! Following the Design Science Research approach "exploring by building", this platform will evolve iteratively. We are planning different formats for the start:

- 📚 Aggregated literature lists with methodological publications
- ☑️ Best practices for the application of design science research
- 📄 Blogposts on various topics
- 🧑‍🔬 Experience reports from researchers
- 🖥 A structured course with videos about the method

We welcome your feedback or participation at any time. Feel free to write us a message! Have fun exploring the site.

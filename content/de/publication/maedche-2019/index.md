abstract: Design science research (DSR) aims to deliver innovative solutions for real-world
  problems. DSR produces Information Systems (IS) artifacts and design knowledge describing
  means-end relationships between problem and solution spaces. A key success factor
  of any DSR research endeavor is an appropriate understanding and description of
  the underlying problem space. However, existing DSR literature lacks a solid conceptualization
  of the problem space in DSR. This paper addresses this gap and suggests a conceptualization
  of the problem space in DSR that builds on the four key concepts of stakeholders,
  needs, goals, and requirements. We showcase the application of our conceptualization
  in two published DSR projects. Our work contributes methodologically to the field
  of DSR as it helps DSR scholars to explore and describe the problem space in terms
  of a set of key concepts and their relationships.

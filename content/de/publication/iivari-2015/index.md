abstract: This paper distinguishes and contrasts two design science research strategies
  in information systems. In the first strategy, a researcher constructs or builds
  an IT meta-artefact as a general solution concept to address a class of problem.
  In the second strategy, a researcher attempts to solve a client's specific problem
  by building a concrete IT artefact in that specific context and distils from that
  experience prescriptive knowledge to be packaged into a general solution concept
  to address a class of problem. The two strategies are contrasted along 16 dimensions
  representing the context, outcomes, process and resource requirements.

abstract: "Design research promotes understanding of advanced, cutting-edge information systems through the construction and evaluation of these systems and their components. Since this method of research can produce rigorous, meaningful results in the absence of a strong theory base, it excels in investigating new and even speculative technologies, offering the potential to advance accepted practice."

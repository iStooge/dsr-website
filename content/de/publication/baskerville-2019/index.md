abstract:
  The importance of creativity is widely acknowledged in design science research,
  yet there is a lack of understanding of how this creativity is manifested throughout
  the design science lifecycle. This research examines the effects of the boundaries
  that are placed on creativity by the particular design science research method used
  throughout the design cycles and iterations. The progressive and methodical nature
  of design science research imposes structure comprising rational and creative, boundaries
  on the problem-solving process. These boundaries determine when and where to iterate
  to a specific previous stage. A set of iteration indicators, derived from the literature
  on creativity and bounded rationality, provide the design researcher with guidance
  on how to recognize that the time for iteration is nigh. These indicators are evaluated
  using a case study for the design of creative, pervasive games.

abstract: Prior research has identified the similarity of Action Research (AR) and
  Design Science Research (DSR). This paper analyses AR and DSR from several perspectives,
  including paradigmatic assumptions of ontology, epistemology, methodology, and ethics,
  their research interests, and activities. We identify that often AR does not share
  the paradigmatic assumptions and the research interests of DSR, that some activities
  in DSR are always mutually exclusive from AR, and that there may be no, little,
  or significant (but not total) overlaps between AR and DSR. Thus we judge that AR
  and DSR are decisively dissimilar. We further identify several key problems with
  combining AR and DSR based on the ethical requirement of researchers to identify
  and manage risks to research stakeholders. Management of such risks is done by careful
  disclosure, identifying research limitations or by choosing alternative methods
  than AR for accomplishing DSR.

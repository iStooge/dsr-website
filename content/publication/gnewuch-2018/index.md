abstract:
  Reducing and shifting energy consumption could contribute significantly
  to a more sustainable use of energy in households. Studies have shown that the provision
  of feedback can encourage consumers to use energy more sustainably. While there
  is wide variety of energy feedback solutions ranging from in-home displays to mobile
  applications, there is a lack of research on whether and how conversational agents
  can provide energy feedback to promote sustainable energy use. As conversational
  agents, such as chatbots, promise a natural and intuitive user interface, they may
  have great potential for energy feedback. This paper explores how to design conversational
  agents for energy feedback and proposes design principles based on existing literature.
  The design principles are instantiated in a text-based conversational agent and
  evaluated in a focus group session with industry experts. We contribute with valuable
  design knowledge that extends previous research on the design of energy feedback
  solutions.
